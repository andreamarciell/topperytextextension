Patched on import/export triggers:
- Added "Importa" and "Esporta" buttons in settings UI (below the Add button).
- Added hidden file input for importing .json.
- Implemented import/export logic in settings.js with validation, deduplication,
  and safe fallbacks using chrome.runtime messaging.
- (Optional) Added minimal CSS utility classes if settings.css exists.
